**[Surgical forceps](https://www.dynamicmedicalsolution.com/categories/general-instrumentation)**
are medical instruments with a historic legacy. They are derived from two words formus and caper;
formus means hot and caper means to hold. Men have used them for different purposes. Formerly, they
were made of bronze and iron, but with the advancement of science and technology, a tremendous
change in their shape, design, and material has occurred. Now they are highly specialized, and most are
made of stainless steel.
In this blog, we will discuss 12 important **[types of surgical forceps](https://www.dynamicmedicalsolution.com/products/forceps)** and their functions:

## Endodontic Forceps
<div className="md:flex justify-between">
  <div className="md:w-3/4">
    - Endodontic Forceps are also known as Mixter Forceps. They fall into the category of cutting and dissecting instruments. The tip may be curved at 90 degrees. They have cross-hatch serrations that run along the length of the inner jaws. They are used for the dissection of tubular structures.

<div className="md:flex justify-between">
  <div className="md:w-3/4">
    - Maryland Bipolar Forceps are also known as bipolar forceps or Maryland forceps. They fall into the category of accessory instruments. It is a bipolar device. The jaws are curved, and the base is perforated. They are used for holding and condensing tissues.

## Dissecting Forceps
<div className="md:flex justify-between">
  <div className="md:w-3/4">
    - Dissecting Forceps are also known as PK forceps. They fall into the category of accessory instruments. Their outer jaws are curved and tapering, while the inner jaws have serrations that run horizontally. They are used for cutting and condensing tissues. They are unique because they are equipped with radiofrequency energy to move or shut tissues. The temperature is kept very low because this reduces tissue blackening and adhesion.

## Resano Forceps
<div className="md:flex justify-between">
  <div className="md:w-3/4">
    - Resano Forceps are also known as shark Forceps. They fall into the category of grasping and holding instruments. Their outer jaws are smooth and straight. The serrations are triangular and lock when closed. They provide firm handling of atraumatic tissues.

## ProGrasp™ Forceps
<div className="md:flex justify-between">
  <div className="md:w-3/4">

## Kleppinger Bipolar Forceps
<div className="md:flex justify-between">
  <div className="md:w-3/4">
    - Kleppinger Bipolar Forceps fall into the category of accessory pigments. They are used for the congelation of tissues during laparoscopy. One end is attached to a bipolar cord. When the targeted tissues are grasped, bipolar energy is activated, which helps in stepping on the foot pedal. It delivers current from one tip to the opposite tip. A dispersive pad is unnecessary because the electric current doesn’t pass through the patient’s body.

## Plate Forceps
<div className="md:flex justify-between">
  <div className="md:w-3/4">
    - Plate forceps are also known as plate holders, plate-holding forceps, or plate clamps. They fall into the category of grasping and holding. They are different from one another in two ways: one, the type of bone being fixed, and second, the type of plating system being used. The foot and the plate are designed to fit into one another for a strong grip. The foot can swing to settle the forceps onto the plate more precisely. They are used in orthopedic surgery to hold plates in place during screw placement.
