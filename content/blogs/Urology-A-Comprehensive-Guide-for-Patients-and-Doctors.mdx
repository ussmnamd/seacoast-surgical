- Kidney
- Male reproductive organs
  All problems related to these organs are treated by urologists, which may involve surgical and nonsurgical interventions.

## Urology Surgical Instruments

Major instruments used in urology belong to several categories depending on the type of disease
being addressed:

- **Cytoscope**: An external**[urology surgical
  instrument](https://www.dynamicmedicalsolution.com/products/urology)**inserted into the body
  through the urethra, equipped with a camera for examining the urinary bladder and ureter.
- **Urethrotome**: Specially designed instrument for cutting urethral structures to open narrowed
  parts of the urethra, often used in urethrotomy procedures.
- **Ureteroscope**: Device with a camera and light source for live imaging of the urinary system.
- **Laproscope**: Tubular instrument with a camera, light source, and video monitor for 3D
  visualization during surgery.
- **Lasers**: Various laser technologies such as Diode laser, Holmium Laser, Thulium Laser, and dye
  laser are used for diagnosis and treatment.

## Basic Urology Tests

- **Ultrasound**: Essential for diagnosing urological diseases, providing visualization of organs, size,
  shape, and the presence of foreign particles.
- **Blood Tests**: Common for urinary infections, measuring substances filtered by the kidneys.
  Abnormal levels indicate kidney problems.
- **Urinalysis**: Involves physical and chemical analysis of urine for color, thickness, pH, proteins,
  blood cells, Bilirubin, and Urobilinogen.
- **Bladder Biopsy**: Used for diagnosing bladder cancer or inflammation by taking tissue samples
  from the infected area.
