Oral health is of utmost importance for the prevention of many microbial infections. It is because the oral cavity is the primary entrance to many kinds of germs, microorganisms, and other substances. And if this primary source is kept hygienic, the chances of getting sick are reduced. For this purpose, biomedical engineers have developed several dental hygiene instruments.

A dental hygiene instrument is a non-surgical **[dental instrument](https://www.dynamicmedicalsolution.com/categories/dental-instruments)** used for dental and oral care. It is used by both professionals and the general public for everyday use. It is user-friendly, environment-friendly, and cheap.
